# TermialDungeonRunner (Name Only Temporary)
This is a shitty, multi-platform dungeon runner written in python, using no external modules... It works

### How to play the game?
Well, it's quite simple actually. Have Python installed (Python 3), and run 
`python3 main.py` 

**Well, how do i *play* the game?**

Again with the silly questions?

WASD For moving
  
M = Shoot
 
Thats it, now go kill %'s, #'s @'s and other evil characters
